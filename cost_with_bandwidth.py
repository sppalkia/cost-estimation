# Routines to get various cost metrics from an expression.
"""
The cost framework works as follows.

Costs are only computed for parallel constructs in the language, namely For
loops. Expressions not nested under for loops are not considered (this may
change later, e.g. if an "if" statement branches into two different
for loops).

Costs are decomposed into two components: a _memory cost_ and a
_processing cost_.

The processing cost states the amount of CPU used in a given loop. For example,
in the loop for(V, |x| -> x + 1), the total processing cost would be len(V),
since len(V) iterations of the loop are run and each iteration performs
(roughly) one cycle of processing. The processing cost assumes value are already
in registers.

Processing cost can also capture instruction-level optimizations such as
vectorization. For example, if we were to vectorize the above loop to have
stride 4 (for(V, 4, |x| -> x + (1,1,1,1))), the cost would become len(V) / 4
since each instruction still only takes one cycle, but 1/4 the number of iterations
are run.

Memory cost captures the cost of loading values from the memory heirarchy. This
is an attempt at simplifying the model used before, making sure to take into
account the bandwidth of the memory sub-system.
